# SCOA_miniproject

One of Major problem faced by cyberworld
▪ easier to trick someone into clicking a malicious link which seems legitimate
than trying to break through a computer’s defense systems

▪ Leads to financial losses for both industry and individual

▪ Fraudulent attacks usually made through emails

▪ Total 2.97 billion people worldwide use Internet facility i.e 38%

▪ Various insecure sites ease the work for attackers

▪ Attempt to Steal personal information

▪ Occurs when attacker tries to dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message

#Need for phishing detection
users and internet content
● Users unwillingly click phishing
domains every day and every hour

● the annual worldwide impact of
phishing could be very high as $5
billion

● lack of awareness of users

#Phishing Detection Methods
● Feature based Categories

○ URL- Based Features

■ Distinctive points

■ Digit count, total length of URL, no. of subdomains etc

○ Domain-Based features

■ Passive queries related to domain name

■ Name of domain is blacklisted or not

■ Days passed sense registration of domain

■ Is registrant name hidden

○ Page-Based Features

■ Information about page is calculated

■ Global Pagerank. Country pagerank, average visit duration , etc

○ Content-Based Features

■ Page titles, meta tags, hidden texts, text in body images,etc

■ Analyzes whether it is needed to login or not

#Phishing Websites Dataset

● Phishing website dataset

● Dataset has 30 optimized features of URL

● 11054 instances of legitimate and phishing websites

● Features as per feature-Based phishing Url detection methodology

● Each feature holds value -1,0, or 1
▫ -1 indicates safe website
▫ 0 indicates suspicious
▫ 1 indicates phishing website

How Genetic Algorithm Works?

● Helps getting the best parameters

● The algorithm has 10 generation

● Single cross-over function

● Finds best parameters for algorithm that is to be applied

● Accuracy we obtained 99.03

#Multilayer Perceptron

▪ Feed forward neural network

▪ Three layers input output and
hidden layer

▪ Used for finding patterns

▪ prediction and classification is
performed by the output layer

▪ Genetic Algorithm helps to
find optimal hidden layer
parameter

▪ We experiment different
activation functions

▪ Best combination of activation
function,,solver,and hidden
layer parameters is given by
GA
